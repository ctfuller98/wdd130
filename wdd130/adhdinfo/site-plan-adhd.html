        [ADHD is an extremely common type of disorder nowadays that is changing the community in tons of different ways. The reason why it’s changing everything is because people with ADHD seem to have a lot more difficulty in focusing and making friends compared to other people in the world. This can cause a lot of confusion for these people and make it so that it’s a lot harder for them to be in the world with people who don’t have ADHD.]

      <h3>[Information on ADHD]</h3>
      <p>
        [I want people to come to this website to learn about the things that can change who they are with ADHD. I don’t want you to become a completely new person, but I want you to be able to know how to get along with what the rest of the world thinks compared to what you are thinking of. Children and adults with ADHD have trouble comprehending the things that others comprehend and they have triggers that cause them to have ADHD moments that confuse others and make them think that you don’t belong with their friend group or with them in their lives because you are different. I want that to change. I want the people that visit my site to come with questions about ADHD in general and things about it that you may not know or that you may know a little bit about, but should learn a little more. I also want you to come with questions about how to become better people and how to be better at understanding how the rest of the world works and how the rest of the people in the world think compared to how you think. One of the biggest activities on my site is a way for you to learn what triggers are in ADHD and to learn how to cope with these specific triggers so that you can recognize them in your everyday life when you are around other people who don’t understand what you’re going through. These triggers can go from something like someone calling you names, to you thinking about something from your past that makes you extremely uncomfortable and you don’t want to be around anyone and you can’t concentrate or think about anything else besides that. I want these specific triggers to help you in ways that it hasn’t helped a lot of people because they don’t know how to recognize them and they don’t know how to see the triggers that are happening and put a stop to them before they can cause any damage]

      <h3>[How to Help]</h3>
      <p>
        [To be able to do anything on my website you need to have ADHD and you need to be able to control yourselves to the point where you are able to focus on what I’m saying on this site and you need to focus on how you can better your lives a little more. I want this site to be more helpful than other websites about ADHD because I personally have ADHD and I am able to explain my thought processes in a way that people without it can’t. People without ADHD will never understand how hard it is to concentrate on things, and how to not be “annoying” to other people around you because they don’t know how we think. I want you to be able to trust what I’m saying and to know that I have experienced the things that you have experienced. ]
