            <p>Symptoms of ADHD: Most symptoms of ADHD start becoming noticable around the age of 12 but can be seen down to the age of 3 years old. Some symptoms of ADHD include not being able to control themselves in certain circumstances, not being able to focus on their surroundings or what's being said to them, having trouble organizing tasks and activities, being easily distracted from what you're doing, and forgetting to do things randomly when you knew what you were going to do them moments before. Some physical symtoms may include figetting with hands or feet or any other part of the body, being in constant motion compared to others, talking too much and going on random tangents or rants, and having difficulty with interrupting people. If you notice any of these things with someone you know and especially a child, please contact or consult a doctor as soon as possible to get diagnosed and possible medicated to help. Some risk ractors of ADHD include being related to someone else with ADHD, premature birth, and if the mother has used drugs in the past.</p>
